# Poem generator

This repository demonstrates how to create a poem generator as a [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server and webpage. 

The server uses the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) to generate a poem using  [GPT-4o mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/) language model. 

This code was part of a tutorial from "codebar.io"
